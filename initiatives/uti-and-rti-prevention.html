        <h1> Project Aim </h1>
        <p> We proposed a randomized control trial (RCT) study to investigate the impact of innovative Sultanaâ€™s 
            reusable cloth pads (improved cloth pad made of flannel cloth and water proof barrier sheet) with 
            appropriate laundering practices, on the incidence of reproductive tract infections and urinary tract 
            infections (UTIs) in women. Based on the eight school and eight readymade garments factory pilot testing experiences, 
            the uptake of the of Sultana reusable cloth pad was over 76% among both women and girls and it reduced absenteeism both in schools 
            (by 8%) and in the RMGs (by 1%). The pad was comfortable, did not stain, soft and reusable throughout the assessments. 
            The effectiveness of hygienic menstrual products will be assessed in reducing incidence of RTIs, UTIs, and contributing to the reduction 
            of antibiotic use and subsequently the prevention of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying 
            AMR through whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the Illumina platform, in Bangladesh through a comprehensive research 
            and data integration approach.  </p>
