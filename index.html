        <h1> Project Aim </h1>
        <p> We proposed a randomized control trial (RCT) study to investigate the impact of innovative Sultana’s 
            reusable cloth pads (improved cloth pad made of flannel cloth and water proof barrier sheet) with 
            appropriate laundering practices, on the incidence of reproductive tract infections and urinary tract 
            infections (UTIs) in women. Based on the eight school and eight readymade garments factory pilot testing experiences, 
            the uptake of the of Sultana reusable cloth pad was over 76% among both women and girls and it reduced absenteeism both in schools 
            (by 8%) and in the RMGs (by 1%). The pad was comfortable, did not stain, soft and reusable throughout the assessments. 
            The effectiveness of hygienic menstrual products will be assessed in reducing incidence of RTIs, UTIs, and contributing to the reduction 
            of antibiotic use and subsequently the prevention of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying 
            AMR through whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the Illumina platform, in Bangladesh through a comprehensive research 
            and data integration approach.  </p>

            <p>•A diverse group of women and adolescents from Bangladesh will provide baseline samples, collected by trained nurses and 
                analyzed for RTIs and UTIs. Randomized intervention groups will receive reusable cloth pads, education via mobile apps, 
                and regular data collection. Clinical data will assess the impact of cloth pad use on RTI and UTI prevention. </p>

            <p>•We'll keep collecting data on RTI and UTI symptoms and specimens from both groups to assess hygienic menstrual product effectiveness in reducing 
                incidence and uncover underlying causes. </p>

            <p>•Lab personnel will extract DNA and conduct Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to assess microbial diversity in urine, stool, and vaginal microbiomes. 
                WGS identifies pathogen genetics, aiding in predicting disease severity, treatment outcomes, and drug-resistant strains. 
                We'll also analyze genes related to antimicrobial resistance to understand resistance development. </p>

            <p>•Assess the impact of web-based tools and mobile apps in educating and raising awareness about sustainable menstrual practices and AMR prevention

            <p>•We'll develop a web tool with data entry and health education sessions featuring informative videos on our app. Training and education will 
                focus on innovative hygienic product use. Real-time data on RTIs and UTIs, antibiotic use, and AMR status will go to the a2i database 
                (https://a2i.gov.bd/), aiding decision-making and interventions, similar to its use for other viral infections. </p>
